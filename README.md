# SupplySync
SupplySync is a program that facilitates the integration of ARRAY and MEDITECH systems, enabling seamless synchronization of inventory. The program utilizes the supply usage batch download from ARRAY and converts it into a Handheld Terminal (HHT) transmission file, adhering to the MEDITECH Materials Management Interface (MM) Specifications. This allows for the efficient importation of data provided by the ARRAY supply usage batch into MEDITECH.
